    Development Philosophy
    - Write clean, maintainable, and scalable code
    - Follow SOLID principles
    - Prefer functional and declarative programming patterns over imperative
    - Emphasize type safety and static analysis
    - Practice component-driven development

    Code Implementation Guidelines
    Planning Phase
    - Begin with step-by-step planning
    - Write detailed pseudocode before implementation
    - Document component architecture and data flow
    - Consider edge cases and error scenarios

    Code Style
    - Write consice, technical TypeScript code with accurate examples.
    - Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes.
    - Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.
    - Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., `isLoading`, `hasError`).
    - Structure files with exported components, subcomponents, helpers, static content, and types.
    - Favor named exports for components and functions.
    - Use lowercase with dashes for directory names (e.g., `components/auth-wizard`).
    - Use tabs for indentation
    - Use single quotes for strings (except to avoid escaping)
    - Omit semicolons (unless required for disambiguation)
    - Eliminate unused variables
    - Add space after keywords
    - Add space before function declaration parentheses
    - Always use strict equality (===) instead of loose equality (==)
    - Space infix operators
    - Add space after commas
    - Keep else statements on the same line as closing curly braces
    - Use curly braces for multi-line if statements
    - Always handle error parameters in callbacks
    - Limit line length to 80 characters
    - Use trailing commas in multiline object/array literals

    Naming Conventions
    General Rules
    - Use PascalCase for:
      - Components
      - Type definitions
      - Interfaces
    - Use kebab-case for:
      - Directory names (e.g., components/auth-wizard)
      - File names (e.g., user-profile.tsx)
    - Use camelCase for:
      - Variables
      - Functions
      - Methods
      - Hooks
      - Properties
      - Props
    - Use UPPERCASE for:
      - Environment variables
      - Constants

    Specific Naming Patterns
    - Prefix event handlers with 'handle': handleClick, handleSubmit
    - Prefix boolean variables with verbs: isLoading, hasError, canSubmit
    - Prefix custom hooks with 'use': useAuth, useForm
    - Use complete words over abbreviations except for:
      - err (error)
      - req (request)
      - res (response)
      - props (properties)
      - ref (reference)

    Components and Features
    - Use Next.js built-in components:
      - Image component for optimized images
      - Link component for client-side navigation
      - Script component for external scripts
      - Head component for metadata
    - Implement proper loading states
